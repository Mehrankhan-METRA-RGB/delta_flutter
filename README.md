##### Countries details
Access to the details of any country by calling this extension `countryDetail` right after country name. 
> **Note:** Double check your country spelling for accurate result. Also avoid extra white spaces between the spellings. Don't worry about Capital or small letters in your `String` as this extension is Case-Insensitive.

##### For example:

```
void main(){

//return details as Type Country 
//
//Can be converted to Json Object or JSON String
//
//In this Example we convert Type Country to JSON String for the sake of avoiding printing Instance of <Country>

print("pakistan".countryDetail.toRawJson());
 

}
```
